## üõ†Ô∏è Ways to Contribute

### üí¨ Start a Discussion

Have an idea or use case to enhance the project? Open a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-drp/DataRightsProfile/discussions)!

For bugs or technical questions, join an existing discussion or create a new one if needed. Discussions are preferred before filing a formal issue if the topic is broad or strategic.

### üêû Open an Issue

Found a bug or want to work on a new feature? Create an issue on our [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-drp/DataRightsProfile/issues).

- First, check for [existing issues](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-drp/DataRightsProfile/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20).
- Use our label system to classify and make issues easy to find.
- Issues with a broader impact or usage questions should start as **discussions** instead.
- Valuable issues that generate feedback may be converted into discussions.
